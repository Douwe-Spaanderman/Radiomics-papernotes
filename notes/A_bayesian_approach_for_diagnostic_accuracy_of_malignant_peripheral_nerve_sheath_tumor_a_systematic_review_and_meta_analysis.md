## [A Bayesian approach for diagnostic accuracy of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article/23/4/557/6039224)

This review focusses on the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive tests for distinquishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign peripheral nerve sheat tumor (BPNST). This is important as biopsies are cumbersome and often in nerve tissue, possible leading to damage. Also, these tumors are heterogenous and are prone to sampling errors. The 43 papers adressed in this review were analysed for their quality by QUADAS-2 tool and statistical analysis was done on extracted data if applicable (TP, FN, FP, TN, sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios). Studies included MRI, FDG-PET and liquid biopsie biomarkers. Together FDG-PET showed to currently be the best method of detecting MPNST.

#### Notes

- No real automated methods of feature extraction/ML used in any of the papers analysed in this review.
