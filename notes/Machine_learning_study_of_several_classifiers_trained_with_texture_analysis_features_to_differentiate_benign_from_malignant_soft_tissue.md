## [Machine learning study of several classifiers trained with texture analysis features to differentiate benign from malignant soft-tissue tumors in T1-MRI images](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmri.22095)

Old paper about differentiating benign from malignant soft-tissue tumors in T1-MRI images. Uses random forest, support vector machine and neural network to distinquish many types of soft-tissue tumors based on 13 radiomics features. These 13 are selected out of a 100 by a optimal feature selection procedure, consisting of ranking and embedding methods. In conclusion, the SVM performed as good or better than radiologists in predicting benign or malignant.

#### Notes

- Very cool is the large variability of tumors (25 types)
- Nice ground work but of course very outdated
