## [An enhanced deep learning approach for brain cancer MRI images classification using residual networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719306177)

A not so interesting paper about classifying, meningioma, glioma and pituitary tumors from 3064 publicly available 2D MRI slides. Resnet50 with 3 neurons in fully connected layers, adam optimized, 80-20 split and various data augmentations. gets good accuracy, does 300 epochs for who knows... as it already converges after ~40.

#### Notes

- Not very interesting paper
- I don't know how clinically relevant this is.. but at least the workflow is fine
