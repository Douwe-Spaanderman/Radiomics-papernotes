## [Differential diagnosis and molecular stratification of gastrointestinal stromal tumors on CT images using a radiomics approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06824)

This paper is very much in line with earlier papers adressed in this repo: ["Differential diagnosis and mutation stratification of desmoid-type fibromatosis on MRI using radiomics"](https://github.com/Douwe-Spaanderman/Radiomics-papernotes/blob/main/notes/Differential_diagnosis_and_mutation_stratification_of_desmoid_type_fibromatosis_on_MRI_using_radiomics.md) and ["Radiomics approach to distinguish between well differentiated liposarcomas and lipomas on MRI"](https://github.com/Douwe-Spaanderman/Radiomics-papernotes/blob/main/notes/Radiomics_approach_to_distinquish_between_well_diiferentiated_liposarcomas_and_lipomas_on_MRI.md). However, this paper focusses on distinquishing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and other intra-abdominal tumors (non-GIST) with radiomics. Additionally, this paper attempts to predict the mutation status of c-KIT, PDGFRA, BRAF for these GISTs (mitotic index, MI). As with the other papers, molecular subtyping is important for prognosis and treatment planning and is currently achieved by an invasive tissue biopsy. Study included 247 (125 GISTs, 122 non-GISTs) originating from 66 scanners. While the model was able to distinquish GISTs from non-GISTs, it was unable to do molecular subtyping. 

#### Notes

- WORC for model search
- 125 GISTs but only 98 had mutation information, while the method could be viable for predicting mutation status, the dataset is just to small for radiomics to learn from.
