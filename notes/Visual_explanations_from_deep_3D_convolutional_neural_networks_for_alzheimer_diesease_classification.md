## [Visual Explanations From Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Alzheimer's Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02544)

Paper focusses on development of 3D convolutional neural networks for alzheimer disease classification from MRI/CT/PET. It tries to uncover the black box as medical research is an evidence centered area, meaning that it is important to know why certain medical decision will be made. Models made are 3D-VGGNet and 3D-ResNet. Furthermore, paper discusses four approaches to obtain visual explanation heatmaps for predictions from 3D-CNNs. 

#### Notes

- Models look interesting for monAI
- not so sold on the visual explanation for why it predicts which class.
