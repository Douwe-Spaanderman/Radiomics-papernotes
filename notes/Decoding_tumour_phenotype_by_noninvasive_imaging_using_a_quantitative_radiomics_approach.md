## [Decoding tumour phenotype by noninvasive imaging using a quantitative radiomics approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5006)

High impact paper using radiomics for lung, head and neck cancers. CT scans from multiple institutes, in total 1019 patient, are used to assess the prognostic value of radiomic features and association with gene-expression profiles. Unsupervised clustering pointed out that there is a clear connection between radiomic features and clinical data, such as tumour stage, lymph node, metastatis status, and histology. Next radiomic features were assessed for prognostic value, selecting 100 most stable features (see notes). Multivariate cox proportional hazard regression model for prediction of survival. Radiomic features outperfomed baseline Volume as a prognostic value. Conclusion, very promosing indication that Radiomics has progsostic value and can therefore predict patient survival. Also, significant assocations between signature features (used for predicting survival) and gene-experession patterns was found indicating the use of radiomics as a probe for different bioloic mechanisms, such as heterogeneity.

#### Notes

- Very interesting prediction of Kaplan meier survival based on radiomic data. 
- using publicly available RIDER dataset to test-retest CT scans 15 min apart, to see how consistent (stable) radiomic features were!
- External validation sets
- Between scanners raw information was used without pre-processing or normilaztion as an argument of better generalizability and use in multicentric application.
