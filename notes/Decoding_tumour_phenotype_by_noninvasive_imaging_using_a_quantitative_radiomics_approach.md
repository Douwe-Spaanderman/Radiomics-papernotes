## [Decoding tumour phenotype by noninvasive imaging using a quantitative radiomics approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5006)

High impact paper using radiomics for lung, head and neck cancers. CT scans from multiple institutes, in total 1019 patient, are used to assess the prognostic value of radiomic features and association with gene-expression profiles. Unsupervised clustering pointed out that there is a clear connection between radiomic features and clinical data, such as tumour stage, lymph node, metastatic status, and histology. Next radiomic features were assessed for prognostic value, selecting 100 most stable features (see notes). Multivariate cox proportional hazard regression model for prediction of survival. Radiomic features outperformed baseline Volume as a prognostic value. Conclusion, very promising indication that Radiomics has prognostic value and can therefore predict patient survival. Also, significant associations between signature features (used for predicting survival) and gene-expression patterns was found indicating the use of radiomics as a probe for different biologic mechanisms, such as heterogeneity.

#### Notes

- Very interesting prediction of Kaplan meier survival based on radiomic data. 
- using publicly available RIDER dataset to test-retest CT scans 15 min apart, to see how consistent (stable) radiomic features were!
- External validation sets
- Between scanners raw information was used without pre-processing or normalization as an argument of better generalizability and use in multi-centric application.
