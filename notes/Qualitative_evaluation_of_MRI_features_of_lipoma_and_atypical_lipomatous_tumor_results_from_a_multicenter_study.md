## [Qualitative evaluation of MRI features of lipoma and atypical lipomatous tumor: results from a multicenter study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00256-020-03372-5)

Distinguishing lipoma (L) from atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT) using MRI qualitative feature. ALT confirmed with histopathology for 70 out 246 patients. Important to distinguish as both undergo different surgical approaches/removal. all images were independently reviewed by two radiologists and senior radiologist was used for consensus in case of disagreement. MRI features manually selected included lesion size, site, depth, fat suppression and architecture. These features were used in a multivariable analysis for the diagnosis of ALT.

#### Notes

- Histopathology identification of ALT is normally based on atypical hyper-chromatic nuclei and is challenging. As it is challenging, in case of doubt a second pathologist and/or FISH testing was performed to evaluate presence of MDM2 (marker of ALT). Still some could be wrongly labeled.

- no ML stuff just manually selecting some features
