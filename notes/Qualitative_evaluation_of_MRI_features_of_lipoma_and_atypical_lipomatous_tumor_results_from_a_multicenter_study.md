## [Qualitative evaluation of MRI features of lipoma and atypical lipomatous tumor: results from a multicenter study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00256-020-03372-5)

Distinquishing lipoma (L) from atypical lipmatous tumor (ALT) using MRI qualitative feature. ALT confirmed with histopathology for 70 out 246 patients. Important to distinquish as both undergo different surgical approaches/removal. all images were independently reviewed by two radiologists and senior radiologist was used for consenses in case of disagreement. MRI features manually selected included lesion size, site, depth, fat supression and architecture. These features were used in a multivariable analysis for the diagnosis of ALT.

#### Notes

- Histopathology identification of ALT is normally based on atypical hyperchromatic nuclei and is challenging. As it is challenging, in case of doubth a second pathologist and/or FISH testing was performed to evaluate presence of MDM2 (marker of ALT). Still some could be wrongly labeled.
- 21 scanners
- no ML stuff just manually selecting some features
