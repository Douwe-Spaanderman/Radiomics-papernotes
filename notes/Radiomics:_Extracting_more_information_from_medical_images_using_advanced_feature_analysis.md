## [Radiomics: Extracting more information from medical images using advanced feature analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804911009993)

Importance of limiting the use of invasive biopsies for solid cancers as these are spatially and hetrogenous. Opportunity to use advanced feature analysis for medical images to capture molecular and intra-tumoural heterogeneity for these types of tumors, refered to as Radiomics. Paper highlights the advancements made in medical devices, such as the use of merged technologies CT and PET scan. The use of imaging markers, e.g. hypoxia markers using PET scans and the use of automated image analysis for automated detection. Radiomics pipeline is described by imaging, segmentation, feature extraction and analysis of the features, with the goal to provide accurate risk stratification by incorporating the imaging traits into predictive models for treatment outcome and to evaluate their added value to commonly used predictors. Hopeful future goals are described such as infering phenotypes or gene-protein signatures. 

#### Notes

- External datasets are very important to establish causal relationship between gene expression patterns and image features.
- Multi-centric setting would also provide more impact
