## [Would Mega-scale Datasets Further Enhance Spatiotemporal 3D CNNs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04968)

Use of mega-scale video dataset to improve spatiotemporal 3D CNNs. Paper uses a variety of datasets to train 3D and pseudo-3D (2+1D) for video classification. They did pre-training on Kinetics-700, MiT and STAIR action. Also additional fine-tuning UCF-101, HMDB-51 and ActivityNet. Used 3D ResNet architecture. ImageNet pre-training improved accuracy already with 10% used.

#### Notes

- Interesting that based on their experiments, merged datasets do not always work well in video classification
- Need to find an easier and more practical approach to enhancing pre-trained 3D CNNs
