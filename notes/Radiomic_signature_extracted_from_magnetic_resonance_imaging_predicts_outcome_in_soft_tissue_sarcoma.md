## [Radiomic Signature Extracted from Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Outcomes in Soft Tissue Sarcoma](https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(17)31240-3/fulltext)

This paper tested the use of radiomics signatures from MRI to improve the prediction of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to clinical features alone. 44 radiomic features were extracted, not specified which. Next, L2-norm penalized ridge regression Cox model were used to generate separate PFS and OS for clinical features alone and clinical features + radiomic features.

#### Notes

- short supplement paper
- Radiomic features have predictive value for PFS and OS
